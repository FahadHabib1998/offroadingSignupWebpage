# Images Folder

Place your vehicle images in this folder with the following names:

## Required Images:

1. **hero-vehicle.jpg** - Main hero image (full-width background for homepage)
   - Recommended size: 1920x1080px or larger
   - This will be the main image at the top of the website

2. **vehicle1.jpg** - First gallery image (Toyota FJ Cruiser)
   - Recommended size: 800x450px or larger
   - Will appear in the gallery section

3. **vehicle2.jpg** - Second gallery image (Silver Land Cruiser)
   - Recommended size: 800x450px or larger
   - Will appear in the gallery section

4. **vehicle3.jpg** - Third gallery image (FJ Cruiser off-roading)
   - Recommended size: 800x450px or larger

5. **poster-background.jpg** - Background image for the poster
   - Recommended size: 2970x2100px (A4 landscape at 300dpi)
   - Or any high-resolution landscape image

## Image Tips:

- Use JPG format for photos (smaller file size)
- Optimize images before uploading (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
- Keep file sizes under 500KB each for faster loading
- Images will automatically scale to fit, but higher resolution = better quality

## Alternative:

If you don't have images yet, the website will show placeholder colors. You can add images later by simply placing them in this folder with the names above.
